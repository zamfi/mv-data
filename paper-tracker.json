				"tl;dr: predictability and legibility are different theoretically and practically.",
				"Constructed an experiment where the most predictable and most legible trajectories of motion differed. ",
				"Predictability is all about expectation, and (anecdotally) expectation when it comes to hinged robots is poor â€” motion only along certain axes, or of only single joints in sequence, etc."
